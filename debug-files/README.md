# Finding SVD files
The .svd files can be found in the STM32CubeIDE installation directory. On Mac, show contents of the package and do a search for ".svd" to see all the files. Grab the one you need.

## What is this?
The SVD file contains the description of the processor. It is used when debugging to show the registers and peripherals in the debug view. It is also used to generate the peripheral library.

SVD files are associated with CMSIS and the ARM architecture, generated by ST.
